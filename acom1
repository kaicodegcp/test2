Description
The EAP Strategic Solutions team successfully completed the upgrade and ingestion of Cloudera Docker images version 1.5.5 into the Citi local Docker registry hosted on sd-wv58-kflz.nam.nsroot.net:5000. This activity ensures the latest CDS image set is available internally for secure, offline deployments on OpenShift.

Key Actions Completed:

Ingested over 40 Docker image tarballs from /docker/1.5.5/images/ directory.

Verified successful Docker login to local registry with authentication (admin/admin) and confirmed push readiness.

Loaded and validated images such as:

cloudera/thunderhead-ml-api:1.5.4-h5-b24

cloudera/dex/dex-rss:1.22.1-b108

cloudera_thirdparty/vault:1.17.2-r0

Confirmed images are visible and accessible via docker images after upgrade using Podman compatibility mode.

Benefit to the team:

Ensures latest Cloudera Data Services (CDS 1.5.5) images are available in Citi’s internal registry.

Supports ongoing CDS deployments in offline OpenShift environments.

Reduces dependency on external internet access and improves security posture through internal image hosting.

Next Steps:

Perform vulnerability scans on newly ingested 1.5.5 images using the Jenkins-based 3PIIP pipeline.

Update CDS installation automation scripts to reference new image versions.

Archive and backup 1.5.5 images for disaster recovery purposes.
